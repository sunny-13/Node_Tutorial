 ** NODE TUTORIAL COURSE FROM FREECODECAMP.ORG**
 -> This comprises of all the code written through out the 5 hour long NODEjs course.
 -> This course helped in structuring my knowledge of node basics, different modules and how they work, etc.
 -> Clone the repo and run "npm install" for installing the dependencies locally.
 -> This also consists the code related to how eventLopps work in javascript, asynchronous javascript and much more.
 -> To understand any file and the code within it, just copy the code into the app.js and run the command "npm start".

 -> Experiment with the code, break it, make it and have fun!!
